            <p class="dog-history">Dogs have been thousands of man's best friends for years. The domestication of dogs began around 15,000 to 40,000 years ago, making them one of the earliest animals to be domesticated by humans. The exact origins of dogs are still a topic of debate among scientists, but it is widely accepted that they are descendants of wolves.</p>
